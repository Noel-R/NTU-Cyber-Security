File Usage:

    The 'Cyber_Security.py' file is runnable, either in command line with the first argument being the name of the
    .pcap file you want to run, it is error checking and will ask you to enter a valid one if it is invalid.

    To run the file from the current directory you would use:
        Cyber_Security.py CyberSecurity2022.pcap

    Pre-Requisites -
        The file uses the following modules:

            datetime
            sys
        It also uses the 'more-itertools' module, which does not come as standard.
